# PyCity Schools Pandas Challenge

## In this challenge, using pandas and Jupyter notebook, I created a report that contains the following data.

### Step 1 - District Summary
- Total number of unique schools
- Total students
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Step 2 - School Summary
- School name
- School type
- Total students
- Total school budget
- Per student budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Step 3
- Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

### Step 4
- Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

### Step 5
- Math Scores by Grade
- Reading Scores by Grade
- Scores by School Spending
- Scores by School Size
- Scores by School Type
